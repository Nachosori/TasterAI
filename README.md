The TasterAI is a neural network model for food categorization. It consists of a database of 15 types of food with an accuracy of 85%. A database with calories and recipes of the foods predicted by the model has also been implemented.

At any time you can train the model with more food types. But at the same time they have to update the calorie data etc. of the foods that are not originally implemented.

The model predicts the following foods: Carrot Cake, Chocolate Cake, Cheesecake, Hamburger, Hot Dog, Cup Cake, Guacamole, Nachos, Gyoza, Ice Cream, Paella, Donuts, Sushi, Macarons and Pizza.
